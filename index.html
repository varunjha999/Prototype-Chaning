    <h1>Prototype & Prototype Chaning</h1>
 
    <h4>Whenever I create an object by default a property name prototype is assigned to it.
    </h4>

    <h4>We didn’t created a function name toString but Still I can access it because of property name prototype.

        Prototype property holds an object.
        
        
        myObject
            -> prototype →prototypeObj
        
            prototypeObj
                ->prototype→prototypeObj2
            
        prototypeObj2
                ->prototype→null
        
        This concept is nothing but prototype chaining.

            ->This date obj has a function called getMonth()
        
        date.getMonth()
        :- It will search in the date obj
        :- Then it will search in the dateProto (found and executed);
        
        date.getMonth =function(){
            return "Tiger Zindha hai";
        }
        
        When this statement was executed.
        
        getMonth function was created inside a date obj.
        
        Date:-
            There is function called getMonth
            Prototype : DateProto
        
        DateProto
            ->This date obj has a function called getMonth()
        date.getMonth()---> Yes and it will execute it.
        
        I can override the default behaviour.

        <h4>This should be predictable, given the description of the prototype chain. When we call getMonth() the browser first looks in myDate for a property with that name, and only checks the prototype if myDate does not define it. So when we add getMonth() to myDate, the version in myDate is called.
            This is called "shadowing" the property.
